How to compile my program:
-Use javac FileName.java on each of the individual java files (javac Game.java, javac Board.java, etc.)

Assumptions:
-That no piece would ever try to be spawned outside of the board boundaries

Bugs:
-If ran in IntelliJ, the row labels may be erroneously included in a 'DEBUG LOG' next to "Board:" for some reason. 
 Just click on it to show it.
-The row numbers are very very slightly off center

Sources:
idea1: I got the idea to use '\u2003' and '\u2004' characters from https://jkorpela.fi/chars/spaces.html


I certify that the information contained in this README
file is complete and accurate. I have both read and followed the course policies
in the ‘Academic Integrity - Course Policy’ section of the course syllabus.
